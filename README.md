You can know 10 languages, 100 frameworks, and author 10 million plugins and still only have touched the tip of the iceberg.  This repo helps me descend the iceberg in a methodical manner

So without further ado, I present my list of programming practices that I desire to learn.

1. Regex.  (I know the basics, but need to dig deeper)
2. Postgres tuning and performance
3. Big Data (hadoop)
3. Golang
4. Native Android (Java)
5. Native iOS (Swift)

In short, rtfm.
